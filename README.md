This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It has a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following commands:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
